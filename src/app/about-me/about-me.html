    Hi, I'm Matthew Santorsa. I'm currently a junior year college student at Wentworth Institute of Technology, majoring in Computer science with a minor in Data Science. Originally, I'm from Bedford, New Hampshire, but now I call Boston my home. I've been coding since middle school, but I've been on the web since 1st grade, if not even earlier. I grew up around tech, I enjoy using tech, and I'd love to help enhance and further the field.
